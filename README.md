### Introduction
SubseqHash2 is a seeding method that uses minimized subsequence as seeds. This repository provides source code for 4 different experiments in different folders.
The folder `hashcollision` contains code for computing the probability of hash collision of different methods.
`alignment` has code for comparing different methods in pairwise sequence alignment. `readmaping` has code for comparing different methods in mapping reads to reference genome.
`overlap-detection` provides code for comparing SubseqHash with other methods on the seeding step of overlap detection.

### Usage

The repository can be installed with following command. The detailed instruction of each experiment can be found in the corresponding folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/Shao-Group/subseqhash2.git
